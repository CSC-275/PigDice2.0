# Pig Dice 2.0

## Directions
The goal of this assignment is to create a fully object oriented solution to the same Pig Dice game you completed 
using a procedural programming approach. To do this assignment you will complete the template provided by adding the implementation code for each class header in the template. 

Once you get the program debugged and working locally, push the final project up to your GitHub repository.
